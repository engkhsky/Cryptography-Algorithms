## Trapdoor Knapsack

**Description:**  
Implementation of Trapdoor Knapsack encryption scheme using Java.

- When the program is run, itfirst asks for the size of the super-increasing knapsack, then the user is asked to enter the value of each element in the private key.
- Then, the user is asked to enter a modulus, follows by a multiplier. Public key will be generated.
- Now, a set of message is being asked, and the ciphertext will need to be displayed.
- Finally, a ciphertext will need to be asked and the correct decryption of the ciphertext
will need to be displayed.

**Instructions:**

1. Compile file: javac TrapdoorKnapsack.java

2. Run program: java TrapdoorKnapsack

**Note:**  
- Option 1 : encryption
	- User need to enter message

- Option 2: decryption
	- User need to enter the size of the ciphertext set
	- User will be ask to enter the set of ciphertext 1 by 1.
